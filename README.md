# Springboard Introduction to Data Science
## Potential Capstone Ideas
Develop three broad ideas for your Capstone Project

## Approach to Indentify Project
There are three broad approaches that we can possibly take to identify a Capstone Project topic:

1. Start with a problem that you care about that you think can be solved with data. 
2. Start with a data set that interests you and find a problem that works with it.

Then Work with your mentor to scope it down, and then look for a data set that solves that problem. 
We have selected option 2 as our path forward.

## Dataset for Consideration
We have choosen the UCI Machine Learning Repository for our datasets are available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

1. Car Evaluation - Informed Decision Tool for Consumers

   Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX
   (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). 
   
   The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input
   attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.
   
   Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and
   structure discovery methods. for more information go [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation)

2. A Dataset For Music Analysis - Decison Tool for Mobile DJ/MC's

   Audio track (encoded as mp3) of each of the 106,574 tracks. It is on average 10 millions samples per track.
   Nine audio features (consisting of 518 attributes) for each of the 106,574 tracks.
   Given the metadata, multiple problems can be explored: recommendation, genre recognition, artist identification, year prediction,
   music annotation, unsupervized categorization. The dataset is split into four sizes: small, medium, large, full.

3. Abalone Data Set - Marine Life age determination Tool
   Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone,
   staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which
   are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food
   availability) may be required to solve the problem. From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority
   having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by
   200). For more information go [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)

In summary please review the following dataset/topic for Capstone Project consideration. Additionally, this simple markdown document with the help of Guy Maskall. He made learning R Markdown really, really easy! (Just don't foreget to beware of using blank lines before, particularly, enumerated list items!)
