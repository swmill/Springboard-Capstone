# Springboard Introduction to Data Science
## Potential Capstone Ideas
Develop three broad ideas for your Capstone Project

## Approach to Indentify Project
There are three broad approaches that we can possibly take to identify a Capstone Project topic:

1. Start with a problem that you care about that you think can be solved with data. 
2. Start with a data set that interests you and find a problem that works with it.

Then Work with your mentor to scope it down, and then look for a data set that solves that problem. 
We have selected option 2 as our path forward.

## Dataset for Consideration
We have choosen the UCI Machine Learing Repository for our datasets. Available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
Topics

1. Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical
   decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX
   (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision
   making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates
   cars according to the following concept structure:

   CAR                      car acceptability
   . PRICE                  overall price
   . . buying               buying price
   . . maint                price of the maintenance
   . TECH                   technical characteristics
   . . COMFORT              comfort
   . . . doors              number of doors
   . . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
   . . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
   . . safety               estimated safety of the car

## Summary Writing a simple markdown document is really, really easy! (But beware forgetting blank lines before, particularly, enumerated list items!)
